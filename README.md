Turning and turning in the widening gyre

The falcon cannot hear the falconer;

Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;

More anarchy is loosed upon the world

The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere

The ceremony of innocence is drowned

Random lines added to the poem, not sure its really a very good poem to be honest, I prefer 'If'
Conflict change
